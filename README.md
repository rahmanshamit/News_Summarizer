# News_Summarizer

## Description
The News Summarizer is a project built with Jupyter Notebook, leveraging the NewsAPI to fetch the latest technology news and BART by Facebook to summarize articles.
BART is particularly effective when fine-tuned for text generation (e.g. summarization, translation) but also works well for comprehension tasks (e.g. text classification, question answering). 
This tool is designed to provide users with concise, informative summaries, all accessible within a user-friendly Google Colab notebook interface.

## Features
- Fetches real-time news of chosen category using the NewsAPI.
- Summarizes articles for quick, digestible insights with BART.
- Interactive and shareable Jupyter Notebook environment.
- Designed for ease of use and minimal setup.
